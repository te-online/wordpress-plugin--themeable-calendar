### üí≠ Currently Planned Features

- Have a UI for specifying which template to use (dropdowns and display names for templates)

### Usage

#### Widget

Use the UI in the Widgets area to add a calendar to a sidebar and set the options. The options are similar to the options for the shortcode (see below).

#### Shortcode

Use the shortcode like this: `[calendar num_events="5" template="my_template_file_in_theme_directory.php" archive="false" calendar="calendar's slug"]`

All options are optional.

- `num_events` ‚Äì the number of events to display.
- `template` ‚Äì¬†the name of the template file in your theme's directory. Defaults to `default` which is the template shipped with this plugin.
- `archive` ‚Äì whether or not to display *only* events from the past.
- `calendar` ‚Äì¬†the calendar to use for displaying events. Multiple comma separated.
